# Iris API Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to remove iris API and model references from the MLOps housing pipeline while maintaining full functionality for the housing API, monitoring, retraining, and CI/CD.

## Files Modified

### 1. Docker Configuration
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Removed iris-api service, updated retraining service dependencies
- **`Dockerfile`**: Removed irislogs directory creation

### 2. Monitoring Configuration
- **`monitoring/prometheus.yml`**: Removed iris-api scraping configuration

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**: 
  - Removed irislogs directory creation
  - Removed iris model training step
  - Updated deployment script to remove iris API health checks and service references

### 4. API Files
- **`api/housing_api.py`**: 
  - Updated retraining request model to only support housing models
  - Removed iris model retraining logic
  - Updated model type descriptions

### 5. Retraining Components
- **`src/retraining_scheduler.py`**: 
  - Removed iris model references from performance monitoring
  - Updated model type options to only include housing

### 6. Testing and Validation
- **`test_validation.py`**: 
  - Removed iris validation test function
  - Removed iris model loading test
  - Updated main test runner to exclude iris tests
- **`test_samples.json`**: Removed entire iris_api test data section

## Changes Made

### Docker Services
- ✅ Removed `iris-api` service from docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Updated `retraining-service` to only depend on `housing-api`
- ✅ Removed irislogs volume mounts
- ✅ Removed irislogs directory creation in Dockerfile

### Monitoring
- ✅ Removed iris-api job from Prometheus configuration
- ✅ Maintained housing-api, retraining-service, and MLflow monitoring

### API Functionality
- ✅ Updated retraining endpoints to only handle housing models
- ✅ Removed iris model retraining logic
- ✅ Updated model type validation and descriptions
- ✅ Maintained all housing API functionality

### Retraining Pipeline
- ✅ Simplified retraining scheduler to focus on housing models
- ✅ Removed iris performance monitoring
- ✅ Updated retraining logic to only process housing models

### Testing
- ✅ Removed iris API validation tests
- ✅ Removed iris model loading tests
- ✅ Cleaned up test data to only include housing examples
- ✅ Maintained comprehensive housing API testing

## What Remains Functional

### ✅ Housing API
- Complete housing price prediction functionality
- Input validation and error handling
- Prometheus metrics and monitoring
- Health checks and status endpoints

### ✅ Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection for housing API
- Grafana dashboards (housing-focused)
- MLflow model tracking
- Performance monitoring

### ✅ Retraining Pipeline
- Automated housing model retraining
- Performance-based retraining triggers
- Background retraining service
- Model versioning and tracking

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline
- Code quality checks
- Housing model training and validation
- Docker image building and deployment
- Security scanning
- Automated deployment

## Impact Assessment

### Minimal Risk Changes
- **Low Risk**: Configuration file updates (docker-compose, prometheus)
- **Low Risk**: Test file cleanup (removing iris tests)
- **Low Risk**: Documentation updates

### Moderate Risk Changes
- **Medium Risk**: Retraining logic updates (requires testing)
- **Medium Risk**: API endpoint modifications (requires validation)

### No Impact
- **Zero Impact**: Housing API core functionality
- **Zero Impact**: Monitoring and observability
- **Zero Impact**: CI/CD pipeline automation

## Verification Steps

1. **Docker Services**: Verify only housing-api and supporting services start
2. **API Endpoints**: Test housing API endpoints for functionality
3. **Monitoring**: Confirm Prometheus scrapes housing-api metrics
4. **Retraining**: Test housing model retraining functionality
5. **CI/CD**: Run pipeline to ensure all tests pass

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Restoring iris-api service in docker-compose.yml
2. Re-adding iris monitoring configuration
3. Restoring iris retraining logic in housing_api.py
4. Re-adding iris test functions

## Conclusion

The iris API removal has been completed with minimal impact on the housing API functionality. All monitoring, retraining, and CI/CD capabilities remain intact and focused on housing price prediction. The system is now streamlined to support a single, well-maintained housing API service.
